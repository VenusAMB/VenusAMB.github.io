    <p>Greetings, my name is Venus Brown and I am consistent with reinventing myself.
        Over the years I have had the opportunity to travel internationally while raising
        a family, working full-time from home and going to school. My career started in health care as a paramedic in Philadelphia, PA and went into 
        Early Childhood Education as soon as my family started to grow. I have worked in 
        mortgage industry as a HUD Certified Housing and Mortgage Processor. Now I am
        embarking on my latest advernture with Augusta Technical College for Coding Bootcamp.
        Wish me luck!</p>
